<h2><b>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</b></h2>
<h2>Version 2, June 1991</h2>
<p>Copyright ?1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<p>59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA Everyone is permitted to
copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it
is not allowed.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away
your freedom to share and change it. By
contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change free software to make sure the software is free for all its
users.<br>
This General Public License
applies to most of the Free Software Foundation’s software and to any other
program whose authors commit to using it.(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU
Library General Public License instead.)<br>
You can apply it to your programs, too.
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,
not price.<br>
Our General Public Licenses
are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of
free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these
things.
<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to
certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or
if you modify it.
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.<br>
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.<br>
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<p>We protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
<p>Also, for each author’s protection and ours, we want to
make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.?<br>If the software is modified
by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they
have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not
reflect on the original authors?reputations.
<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by
software patents.?<br>We wish to avoid the
danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent
licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.<br>
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all.

<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution
and modification follow.
<br>
<br>
<h2>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h2>
<h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h2>
<p>0.   This License applies to any program or other work,
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it, may be
distributed under the terms of this General Public License.<br>
The "Program" below, refers to any such
program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or
any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.<br>
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
"modification".)<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and
modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.<br>
The act of running the Program is not
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
running the Program).?<br>Whether that is
true depends on what the Program does.

<p>1.   You may copy and
distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in
any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each
copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with
the Program.
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
exchange for a fee.

<p>2.   You may modify your
copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based
on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the
terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<p>a)   You must cause the
modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files
and the date of any change.
<p>b)   You must cause any
work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is
derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
<p>c)   If the modified
program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when
started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or
display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the
user how to view a copy of this License.?
<br>(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally
print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to
print an announcement.)
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.<br>
If identifiable sections of that work are
not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to
those sections when you distribute them as separate works.<br>
But when you distribute the same sections as
part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
regardless of who wrote it.
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is
to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
works based on the Program.
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on
the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume
of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
scope of this License.
<p>3.   You may copy and
distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code
or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
also do one of the following:
<p>a)   Accompany it with
the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
used for software interchange; or,
<p>b)   Accompany it with a
written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a
charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a
complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
used for software interchange; or,
<p>c)   Accompany it with
the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source
code.?<br>(This alternative is allowed only
for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object
code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the
work for making modifications to it.?
<br>For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code
for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
executable.?<br>However, as a special
exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by
offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of
the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
along with the object code.
<p>4.   You may not copy,
modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided
under this License.?<br>Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<p>5.   You are not required
to accept this License, since you have not signed it.<br>
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.<br>
These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
License.<br>
Therefore, by modifying or
distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your
acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for
copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
<p>6.   Each time you
redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient
automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute
or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.<br>
You may not impose any further restrictions
on the recipients?exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties to this License.
<p>7.   If, as a consequence
of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other
reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether
by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.<br>
If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at
all.?<br>For example, if a patent license
would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could
satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution
of the Program.
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity
of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public
license practices.?<br>Many people have
made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through
that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software
through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what
is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<p>8.   If the distribution
and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents
or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the
Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in
or among countries not thus excluded.?
<br>In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
the body of this License.
<p>9.   The Free Software
Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public
License from time to time.?<br>Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version
number.?<br>If the Program specifies a
version number of this License which applies to it and “any later version? you
have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
If the Program does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.
<p>10.   If you wish to
incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution
conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.<br>
For software which is copyrighted by the
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.?<br>Our decision
will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
software generally.
<br>
<br>
<h2>NO WARRANTY</h2>
<p>11.   BECAUSE THE
PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO
THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.?
<br>EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS?WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.<br>
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.?<br>
SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.
<p>12.   IN NO EVENT
UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT
HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
